      <h2> Hello! I'm Elizabeth</h2>

        <p> I am a software developer living in Los Angeles, California.<p>

        <p> Aside from pursuing accounting and coding, I also enjoy: </p>

      <h2> About Me!</h2>

        <p> Right out of graduation, I started working at a Big Four accounting firm. During my start with the firm, there was a big push to automate many of our processes using web based applications. After three years at the firm, I found myself more interested in the inner workings of those websites. </p>

        <p> As a new student at Thinkful, I am so excited to begin my journey into coding and explore something that I have been curious about for a few years now. </p>

        <p> I am so excited to meet and work with peers with similar interests! If you would like to chat, please feel free to
